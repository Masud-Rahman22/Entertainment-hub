## Writing about my project in at least five bullet points


ANS -


    * The first thing about this project is the user friendly layout with a navbar,banner,6 types of brands,team section,content-section and lastly the footer section and these sections make the website easy to operate and easy to understand.

    * The second thing is the login and registration and also google login authentication which makes the website secure and there's also private route and for better understanding there's profile picture and username on the navbar.

    * The third one is the information part because each brand has many least 4 products and advertisement that helps user to choose the best product among them and each product has details route that helps to understand the product better.

    * the fourth one is we can also add any product we like in the cart section and for logger in user one can also add a product in the site and surprisingly also can update certain information. This makes the website more interesting.

    * Lastly but not the least this is an entertainment purpose website and as for an entertainment purpose website we can do hardly all of the feature a nomral entertainment website has and the layout and the database and alo the authentication makes the website better than ever.
